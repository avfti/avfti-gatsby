        <p className="hero-description">It is with great sadness that we announce the closure of A Voice for the Innocent. We began as a non-profit in 2012 and served the community until 2022. We were a passionate group of volunteers dedicated to the support of those affected by sexual violence.</p>

        <p className="hero-description">We have distributed all of our assets, in accordance with state law, to the <a href="https://ioncenter.org/" className="underline">Ion Center for Violence Prevention</a> who has been incredibly instrumental in the growth of our organization.</p>

        <h2 className="text-secondary">Thanks</h2>
        <p className="text-white">Our amazing storytellers, volunteers, board members and donors. All organizations who helped fund us, supported us or helped further our mission.</p>
