# A Voice for the Innocent

A Voice for the Innocent is a non-profit community dedicated to the support of those affected by sexual violence by offering a safe and compassionate space to share stories and seek help. All of our projects are created and maintained by volunteers. We're always looking for additional help with React/Gatsby, Elixir/Phoenix, Infrastructure and Security. Please reach out!

# Project Details

This project will serve as our informational website located at <https://avfti.org>. It is built using a static site generator called [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/), which is written in React. Additionally, this project was bootstrapped from the [`Gatsby Advanced Starter`](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter/) template by [Vagr9K](https://github.com/Vagr9K).

## Getting Started

Install the project by running the following commands from your CLI:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:avfti/avfti-gatsby.git
cd avfti-gatsby
yarn
yarn develop # or gatsby develop
```
